# Timeout
---

## Inspiration
Many people find it difficult to study when having the distraction of Facebook, YouTube, online games, etc... and we thought there should be an easy way to block these sites for different periods of time.

## What it does
Timeout allows you to set specific blocks on any website by specifying the start time, affected website, and duration of the block. Any current tabs that are open for that website are instantly blocked with a timer specifying how long until the ban is lifted. If you go to the site on a new tab or current tab, the same system applies.

All "Timeouts" or blocks are synced across all your Chrome devices on your Google accounts and across Chrome restarts.
